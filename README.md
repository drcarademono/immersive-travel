# immersive-travel

A work-in-progress mod for Daggerfall Unity that implements Morrowrind-like fast travel.

Implemented features: 
- Adds carriage drivers to city gates blocks
- Carriage drivers can be talked to to initiate fast travel
- You can no longer fast travel from anywhere
- You can only fast travel to towns, but no longer to dungeons, temples or farms

To-do list:
- Better compatibility with other mods that modifiy fast travel and/or city blocks layout
- Regional variants for carriage drivers (for instance desert regions could have camels instead of horses)
